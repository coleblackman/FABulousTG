# FABulousTG

Internal testing of the FABulous FPGA fabric generator. Specifications occur in 6 different files, resulting in varying RTL output:

1. fabric.csv (configuration specified on page 7-8{pdf:12-13} of FABulous documentation)
2. tiles.csv
3. LUT.vhd
4. pad.vhd
5. CLB.list
6. IO.list

FABulous was written by Dirk Koch, Nguyen Dao, Bea Healy, Jing Yu, and Andrew Attwood. I did not write any portion of it. It is released under Apache License 2.0.
